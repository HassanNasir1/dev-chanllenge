## Instructions

1. **View Chat Messages (HTML)** - Click on "Chat ID = 3 Messages (HTML)" to view messages for Chat ID 3 in HTML format.

2. **View Chat Messages (JSON)** - Click on "Chat ID = 8 Messages (JSON)" to view messages for Chat ID 8 in JSON format.

4. **View Message (HTML)** - Click on "Message ID = 459 (HTML)" to view the content of the message with ID 459 in HTML format.

## Running the Project

To run the project and view the data, use a development server. It is recommended to use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for Visual Studio Code:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Right-click on `index.html`.
3. Choose "Open with Live Server."

This will launch the project in your default web browser, and you can interact with the data.

## Important Note
